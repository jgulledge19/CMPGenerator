# Project Status

This project is currently unmaintained as I have not had time to maintain and will not be able to devote 
time to this project in the future. A new maintainer would be welcome. 


# What is CMPGenerator?

CMPGenerator is intended to be used by PHP developers that want to create 
custom database tables to be used via a snippet, plugin or CMP. CMPGenerator 
is a GUI and it will create the xpdo scheme files and xpdo classes for your 
custom database tables with just a click of a button.  This allows you to 
quickly start using xpdo in your custom projects.
